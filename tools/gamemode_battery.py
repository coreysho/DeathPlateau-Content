"""Battery for the XP rate modes: realism, 5x and 10x.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY AT RISK HERE, and it is not the arithmetic. It is that the multiplier sits in ONE
place and that the choice cannot be remade. There are 288 stat_advance call sites across 122
content files and no wrapper they pass through, so the rate lives in Player.addXp - which means
half of what this checks is in the ENGINE repo, and a content battery can only read its source.
That is exactly the half most likely to be left behind, since it is a separate checkout.

The other half is the lock. A mode that can be changed later is a button that says "give me ten
times the experience", so the checks about ~xprate_choose refusing to ask are the ones that matter
most, and they are written from both sides: the early returns are there, and the interface opens
after them.
