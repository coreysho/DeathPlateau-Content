# Launch day, in order - and where the box says you are in it.
#
#   ./launch-day.sh              the sequence, with what this box reports about each step
#   ./launch-day.sh --quick      ...without the wipe's dry run, which is the slow part
#
# IT CHANGES NOTHING. Every command it runs itself is a read: a git branch, a count of rows, a
# listing of a backup directory, and the wipe's OWN DRY RUN, which prints what it would do and then
# says "Nothing was changed." The steps that act are printed for you to run, never run from here. A
# launch has one irreversible step in the middle of it, and a script that offers to do the whole
# thing unattended is a script that will one day wipe a world nobody meant to wipe.
#
# WHY THE ORDER IS THIS ORDER, which is the part worth reading once before the day:
#
#   the backup goes first        Everything after it is recoverable except the wipe.
#                                backup-offsite.sh takes the four things nothing else protects -
#                                the trading post, the clans, the vote ledger, and login-rsa.pem,
#                                whose modulus is baked into every released client - and puts them
#                                on another machine. The wipe takes its own backups, onto the disk
#                                it is protecting.
#
#   the deploy goes before       The wipe reads every character's save to count the vote points it
#   the wipe                     carries over, and reading a save needs data/pack. It also needs
#                                the schema the deploy migrates to: it checks its tables first and
#                                refuses on an old one, rather than reporting "0 rows" for a table
#                                that is not there. So the code and the packs have to be the launch
#                                ones before anything is cleared.
#
#   the world comes down         The wipe refuses while anybody is logged in, and it is right to:
#   between them                 the server holds a character in memory and writes the file at
#                                logout, so a save taken away underneath a live player comes
#                                straight back at the next logout. deploy.sh ENDS by restarting the
#                                world, so the stop is a step after it, not before.
#
#   the website goes last        A successful web deploy publishes the news post and announces it to
#                                Discord in the same run. The post says the trading post feeds
#                                Discord and that the boards start empty, and both are claims about
#                                an engine that has to be deployed and restarted first. Publish
#                                before that and the notes are briefly wrong.
#
#   the veteran grant has        It writes one column, read at login, and nothing in it reads a live
#   no place in the order        character - so it is safe with the world up, and correct before the
#                                wipe, straight after it, or in a week. It qualifies people by their
#                                save file, and the wipe MOVES saves to wiped-<stamp>/ rather than
#                                deleting them, so the wipe itself produces the roster it reads. It
#                                only ever grants.
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE: anything the CI already answers. Both repos build, pack, lint and sim on every
# push, and the build runs CacheCheck at the end of every run - that is the corrupt-pack fault which
# shows up as a client stuck at 30% on "Connection error". If GitHub is green on 377-wip, the code
# is not the thing to worry about on the day.
